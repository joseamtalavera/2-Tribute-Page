## Code Explanation

The HTML code provided is a simple static webpage dedicated to the tribute of Kobe Bryant, the legendary basketball player. Here's a brief explanation of the logic behind the code:

1. The `<head>` section includes meta information about the webpage and links to the CSS file for styling.

2. The `<body>` contains the main content of the webpage. It is wrapped inside a `<main>` tag with an id of "main".

3. Inside the `<main>` tag, there's an `<h1>` tag with an id of "title" that displays the title of the webpage.

4. A `<p>` tag follows the title, providing a brief description about Kobe Bryant.

5. The `<figure>` tag with an id of "img-div" wraps an image of Kobe Bryant and its caption. The image is embedded using the `<img>` tag with an id of "image". The caption is placed inside a `<figcaption>` tag with an id of "img-caption".

6. The `<div>` tag with an id of "tribute-info" contains information about Kobe Bryant's career highlights. This information is presented in an unordered list (`<ul>`).

7. Each career highlight is placed inside a `<li>` tag.

8. At the end of the list, there's a link to Kobe Bryant's Wikipedia page for further reading. The link is placed inside an `<a>` tag with an id of "tribute-link" and a target attribute set to "_blank" to open the link in a new tab.
